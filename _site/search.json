    "text": "The motivation for this project arises from the remarkable rise of Sailor Shift, a global music phenomenon originating from Oceanus, and the growing cultural influence of the Oceanus Folk genre. As Oceanus transforms from a quiet fishing island into a globally recognized cultural hub, there is an urgent need to trace and understand how Sailor’s career, collaborations, and artistic evolution have contributed to the global diffusion of Oceanus Folk.\nLocal journalist Silas Reed has compiled an extensive musical knowledge graph to trace these influences. Our project aims to support this effort by building an interactive system that enables deep exploration of Sailor’s career trajectory and the broader spread of Oceanus Folk through collaborations, stylistic borrowings, and evolving artist networks."
