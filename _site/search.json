This decision was initially explored during the completion of Take-home Exercise 2 and was reaffirmed in this meeting. The rationale for choosing this challenge is based on the clarity and structure of the dataset compared to the other two options. Specifically, Mini-Challenge 1 contains only network data, without the added complexity of timeline or geographical data, making it more suitable for the scope and focus of our planned analysis.\n\n\n\n\nThe team reviewed the initial methodology outlined in our project proposal and compared it with the individual storyboards developed for Take-home Exercise 3. The original methodology focused on using the Mini-Challenge 1 dataset to visualize the influence network centered around Sailor Shift and to analyze collaboration patterns, genre evolution, and artist relationships.\nDuring the meeting, we identified several refinements based on insights gained through the storyboarding process. Notably, Huang Zihanâ€™s storyboard introduced a genre influence decomposition module using a ternary plot, highlighting demographic influences on genre formation. Min Htet Aung focused on network centrality and clustering to identify key players and genre communities, while Ta Nguyen Thao Nguyen emphasized collaboration timelines and a detailed breakdown of artist roles in shaping Oceanus Folk.\nAs a result, the refined methodology will now integrate:\n\nDynamic network analysis to explore direct and indirect influence paths from Sailor Shift.\nGenre composition breakdowns using demographic aggregations and ternary visualizations.\nCluster and centrality-based profiling to highlight rising stars and influential contributors.\nTemporal and collaborative analysis to trace artist involvement across albums and time.\n\nThese enhancements ensure that the analytical components are both diversified and aligned with the exploratory needs of the dataset, allowing for a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional storytelling approach.\n\n\n\n\nThe team agreed to follow the project timeline shown in our proposal. The timeline includes key steps such as data exploration, building each module, combining everything into the final app, testing, and preparing for the final presentation. Everyone is comfortable with the schedule, and no changes were suggested during the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Repository & Website\nMin Htet Aung will be responsible for setting up and maintaining the GitHub repository and project website (Completed)\nPrototype Development\n\nData Preprocessing: Handled by Min Htet Aung.\n\nEDA: Done collaboratively by Min Htet Aung, Huang Zihan, and Ta Nguyen Thao Nguyen.\n\nNetwork Analysis: Shared among all three members.\n\nPrediction Analysis: Led by Min Htet Aung.\n\nDiscovery Phase\n\nData wrangling and identifying key variables will be done by Min Htet Aung.\n\nShiny App Development\n\nSection 1: Ta Nguyen Thao Nguyen\n\nSection 2: Huang Zihan\n\nSection 3: Min Htet Aung\n\nUser Guide:\nTo be written last, by Ta Nguyen Thao Nguyen and Min Htet Aung, after all modules are completed.\n\nProject Poster\n\nDesigned and created by Ta Nguyen Thao Nguyen\n\n\nEach team member is clear on their responsibilities, and the division of work ensures balanced contribution."

    "text": "The motivation for this project arises from the remarkable rise of Sailor Shift, a global music phenomenon originating from Oceanus, and the growing cultural influence of the Oceanus Folk genre. As Oceanus transforms from a quiet fishing island into a globally recognized cultural hub, there is an urgent need to trace and understand how Sailorâ€™s career, collaborations, and artistic evolution have contributed to the global diffusion of Oceanus Folk.\nLocal journalist Silas Reed has compiled an extensive musical knowledge graph to trace these influences. Our project aims to support this effort by building an interactive system that enables deep exploration of Sailorâ€™s career trajectory and the broader spread of Oceanus Folk through collaborations, stylistic borrowings, and evolving artist networks."

All key milestones, deliverables, and interim checkpoints remain on track, with no major delays or setbacks reported thus far. Weekly check-ins and collaborative tools (such as GitHub, Trello, and group chat channels) have facilitated clear communication and accountability among all members.\nAt this stage, our primary area of focus is the development and refinement of the ShinyApp, which functions as the central component of our project. The ShinyApp is critical, as it directly supports multiple interconnected elements of the overall deliverable, including data visualization, user interaction, and report generation. Ensuring this application is stable, intuitive, and fully functional is essential for the success of the final presentation and supporting materials.\nThe development process is well underway, with progress being made on both the user interface and server-side logic. The team has been actively collaborating on design choices, UI layout, data preprocessing, and reactive elements to ensure the app meets both user expectations and project requirements. Additional attention is being paid to usability and responsiveness, based on feedback gathered during internal testing.\nEach member is aligned with the shared priorities, and individual responsibilities have been clearly distributed to match both technical strengths and learning goals. For example, one member is focusing on the backend server logic, another on dashboard design, while others are contributing to the data cleaning, documentation, and testing processes. This clear division of labor ensures that contributions are balanced and productive across the team.\nLooking ahead, internal testing and peer feedback will guide improvements to ensure the app is polished before the next milestone.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a detailed review of the initial project timeline, the team reached a consensus to revise certain deadlines in order to optimize workflow and reduce last-minute pressure. The most notable change is the advancement of the ShinyApp completion deadline to an earlier date than originally planned.\nThis adjustment was made strategically to allow ample time to focus on the Poster and User Guide, two deliverables that benefit from thoughtful planning, editing, and design. By completing the core application earlier, we create a buffer that enables more deliberate work on documentation and presentation materials, reducing the risk of rushed output near the final deadline.\nIn preparation for the final presentation, a rehearsal session has also been scheduled. This session will allow the team to practice the flow, timing, and delivery of the presentation, ensuring that all team members are confident in their speaking roles and that the content is well-structured and engaging. Any technical hiccups, inconsistencies, or content gaps identified during the rehearsal will be addressed in advance of the actual presentation day.\nFurthermore, the team reaffirmed each memberâ€™s roles and contributions, ensuring clarity on expectations and workloads. This helps prevent overlap, miscommunication, or gaps in task ownership. Progress continues to be monitored weekly, with flexibility built into the timeline to accommodate unexpected challenges or new ideas that may emerge during the development and testing phases.\n\nIn summary, the updated timeline reflects a proactive approach to time management and quality assurance. With a clear roadmap ahead and strong coordination among members, the team is well-positioned to complete all components of the project on time and to a high standard."
